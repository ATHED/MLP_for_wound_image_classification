# MLP_for_wound_image_classification

This project is part of the wearable real-time wound monitor project in Oregon State University funded by NIH NIBIB R01EB028104 grant.

We used data source ULCER_SET as simulation of collected wound imaging data set.  It is publicly available related to paper G. Blanco, A.J.M. Traina and C. Traina Jr. et al.  “A superpixel-driven deep learning approach for the analysis of dermatological wounds”. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmpb.2019.105079

Presentation related to this work has been accepted by the Data Science and Image Analysis Conference of the Pacific Northwest, February 29th & March 1st, 2020 held by Washington State University with title "Continuous monitoring of chronic wounds: Application of multilayer perceptron for image-based classification of wounds"
